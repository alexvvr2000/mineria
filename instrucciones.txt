1) Data Cleaning
   chose a dataset and upload to git repository with next characteristics:
   - At least 4 variables in the dataset
   - At least 2 numeric values
   - at least 1 alphanumeric value
   - at least 1 date value.
   - 1 Dataset preferability.
   - minimum 5000 rows.
2) Descriptive Statistics
   Run descriptive statistics to data, identify the entities and relations and draw its diagram. Also group data by entities and obtain statistics from grouped data.
3) Data Visualization
   Generate graphs and visulizations, pie diagrams, histogram, boxplots, plots and scatter plots, genearate as many as you can using for loops, at least 5 diferent diagrams.
4) Statistic Test
   Prove that labeled data is different by runining ANOVA + T test or kruskall wallis test.
5) Linear Models + correlation
   genearate a Linear model from your data, create necessary graphs and obtain its R2 score.
6) Data classification
   Create a model using k nearest neighbor and test it.
7) Data clustering
   Create a model using k means and test it.
8) Forecasting
   Create a model using linear regression and predict new data. Use a time series.
9) Text analysis
    Create a word cloud from text data.
